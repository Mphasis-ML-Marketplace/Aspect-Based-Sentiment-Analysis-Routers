Installation was pretty straight forward. What is nice about the way this dishwasher is configured is that the hot water connection can be accessed from the front of the machine if you remove the kick plate. So if I had to retighten the water connection or something I wouldn't have to drag the machine out from under the counter.
The instructions could have been written clearer, especially regarding the leveling feet. Heads up to first time dishwasher installers: It only comes with a drain hose. You have to supply the water connections/adapters as well as any appliance electrical plug (If you are not hard wiring it).

It's quiet. It cleans and dries very well. It looks very nice too. However, the baskets are designed for Western dishes and cookware and some Indian dishes, such as stainless steel plates with high sides don't fit easily in the baskets.
